# MinioObjectStorageSamples


### Minio is an Object storage server in the cloud to store files/repos/images and other objects 

The URL is https://www.minio.io/

This platform lets you upload any kind of Repo/photos/images/files/zipfiles from local workstations. This platform implements Amazon's S3 APIs 

Their APIs let you create a bucket in the Minio Cloud to store the objects, List the contents, View buckets, delete and other capabilities.

Here I have sample JavaScript Client code to Createbuckets, List objects, List buckets, Delete buckets etc all based on the Amazon S3 APIs.

The Object storage server Installation, documentation, configuration can be viewed at https://docs.minio.io/
