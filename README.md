# MinioObjectStorageSamples


### My experiments to try uploading repositories to Object storage similar to Amazon S3

Minio lets you upload files/ images/tar files to the cloud, and I was able to do some uploads to the Minio Bucket which is similar to the S3 

Here I have code to createbuckets, put an object ( i.e a zip file) and list the buckets.

Work in progress.

The Object storage server Installation, documentation, configuration in the cloud is https://docs.minio.io/
